                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>We grew up either watching movies or playing video games. And in those contents, we see all sorts of fantasies such as abnormal creatures, magic, physics that defy ours. But what stuck to me the most was the weapons that show ridiculous amount of capabilities. Yes, it is probably impossible for our resources to produce such devastating yet portable weapons seen in those contents, but imagining the possibilities were quite satisfying enough. Therefore, I will be listing down the best fictional weapons from all media.

            <h2 id="lightsaber"><cite>The Lightsaber</cite></h2>
                <p>From the classic series Star Wars, the main protagonists and antagonists wield this weapon as a dueling instrument. The weapon consists of a crystal (which is used as a battery) and a handle. When the switch is flicked, a lingering laser comes out from the handle. The laser is as deadly as it can get, one touch from it can instantly incinerate one’s skin. The lightsaber is so iconic that its sound is recognized by anyone who is knowledgeable about pop culture.</p>

	        <p>From a Japanese anime series Psycho-Pass, this weapon is used by the law enforcers, and is used as an immediate judge and an executioner. The weapon can measure its target’s psychological stability and changes depending on its judgement. Usually, the gun shoots tranquilizer and immobilizes the suspect. However, if the target’s psychological measurement is low, the gun determines that the suspect is a psychopath and changes its ammo to lethal shot. The Dominator’s lethal shot leaves nothing behind of its target as it incinerates their whole body to ashes.</p>

        <h2 id="bfg9000"><cite>BFG 9000</cite></h2>
        <p>This weapon originally used as the main trigger for a much bigger cannon, is picked up by the protagonist of the title Doom: Eternal for a much portable version of the cannon itself. The weapon is considered the strongest weapon in the title because it cleans the area of hostile entities after a few seconds of charge up. However, considering the scarcity of its ammunition it is used with much consideration and timing. The weapon is insanely strong that when it was connected to its cannon, it had the firepower to shoot a hole in Mars.</p>

        <h2 id="hiddenblade">Hidden blade</h2>
        <p>A classic from the video game franchise Assassin’s creed, this weapon is favored by all of the members of the assassins’ syndicate and brotherhood throughout the franchise. Due to its ability to pop in and out of the user’s wrist on which they wore, it keeps the user mobile as well as deadly. In the first few installments of the franchise, the brotherhood would cut their ring finger to pledge royalty and become able use this blade. But from the most recent prequel installment, we know that cutting of the finger was an accident by the first user of the hidden blade.</p>
